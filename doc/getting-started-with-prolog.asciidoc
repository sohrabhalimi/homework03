Installation
------------

This document should guide you through the process of installing
http://www.swi-prolog.org/[SWI-Prolog] and starting on your homework
assignment.  SWI-Prolog is a free and open source Prolog implementation.  There
are other Prolog implementations available, but I have chosen to use this one
as it should provide a consistent user experience across all platforms that
does not require mastery of the command line.

Jump to the section for your operating system:

* <<Installing on Windows>>
* <<Installing on OS X>>
* <<Installing on Linux>>

=== Installing on Windows

This section will guide you through installation of SWI-Prolog on a recent OS X
system.  This has been tested with Windows 7 Professional, but should apply for
any Windows computer running Windows XP, 7, or 8.

==== Step 1. Download SWI-Prolog

From the http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable[SWI-Prolog stable version
download page], download the Windows installer file for the latest stable
release of SWI-Prolog.  Note that there are two versions available for Windows:
32-bit and 64-bit.  You can use either one, but I recommend the 32-bit version.

==== Step 2. Install SWI-Prolog

Once it has finished downloading, you can run the installer.  You may encounter
the following dialogue, where you can just click 'Yes'.

.Windows security dialogue

Work your way through the wizard.  I recommend installing accepting all of the
default settings.  Once installation is complete, you should be able to see
SWI-Prolog in your start menu.

.SWI-Prolog installed
image:win01-swi-prolog-installed.png[width="50%",link="win01-swi-prolog-installed.png"]

==== Step 3. Run SWI-Prolog

If you run SWI-Prolog, you should now see the following window.

.SWI-Prolog running on Windows
image:win02-swi-prolog-running.png[width="50%",link="win02-swi-prolog-running.png"]

If you see this, you can now progress to <<Getting to know SWI-Prolog>>.


=== Installing on OS X

This section will guide you through installation of SWI-Prolog on a recent OS X
system.  This has been tested with a fresh install of Yosemite 10.10.2.

[NOTE]
It is also possible to install SWI-Prolog using homebrew.  However, this will
not install the GUI.  Nonetheless, if you want to opt for this route, feel free
to give it a go.

==== Step 1: Download XQuartz

XQuartz is an implementation of the X Window System that runs on OS X.  This is
used by SWI-Prolog to provide various graphical development tools.  To download
XQuartz, go to its http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/[homepage] and
download `dmg` file for the latest version.

==== Step 2. Install XQuartz

Once it is downloaded, you can find it in your Downloads folder and click on
it.  You should be presented with a window similar to the following:

.Opening XQuartz
image:osx00-open-xquartz.png[width="50%",link="osx00-open-xquartz.png"]

Double-clicking on the XQuartz `pkg` icon will start the installation process.
The first screen you see should look like:

.Installing XQuartz
image:osx01-install-xquartz.png[width="50%",link="osx01-install-xquartz.png"]

Just click your way through the wizard and enter your password when prompted.
You will be told that you will need to log out and log back in, and in the end
the installation should succeed:

.XQuartz installed
image:osx02-xquartz-installed.png[width="50%",link="osx02-xquartz-installed.png"]

You can now close both windows and eject the XQuartz installation image.

.Eject the XQuartz installation image
image:osx03-eject-xquartz.png[width="50%",link="osx03-eject-xquartz.png"]

Finally, go ahead and log out and log back in.  Once you log back in, XQuartz
should be fully configured for you.

==== Step 3: Download and install SWI-Prolog

Next, from the http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable[SWI-Prolog stable
version download page], download the `dmg` file for the latest stable release
of SWI-Prolog and open it.  You should be presented with a window similar to
the following:

.SWI-Prolog installation window
image:osx04-swi-prolog-install.png[width="50%",link="osx04-swi-prolog-install.png"]

Click on the 'Applications' icon to open the applications folder, and then drag
the SWI-Prolog icon to the applications folder.  This will install SWI-Prolog.
Once installation completes, you can close the windows and eject the
installation image.

==== Step 4: Run SWI-Prolog

You should now try to run SWI-Prolog.  If you see the windows and menus as in the
below image, you have successfully installed SWI-Prolog.

.SWI-Prolog running
image:osx05-swi-prolog-running.png[width="50%",link="osx05-swi-prolog-running.png"]

If you see this, you can now progress to <<Getting to know SWI-Prolog>>.

=== Installing on Linux

The specifics of installing on particular Linux distributions is really beyond
the scope of this document.  If you are using Linux, I trust that you know how
to install software for your distribution.  In general, you will be wanting to
install an `swi-prolog` package.
http://www.swi-prolog.org/build/LinuxDistro.txt[This page] has some additional
details on how to install for a few distributions.


== Getting to know SWI-Prolog

This section should guide you through the basics of using SWI-Prolog and should
prepare you for your first Prolog assignment.

=== Performing basic queries

Once you have started SWI-Prolog, you will be in a window with a prompt `?-`.
This prompt allows you to perform queries on the current database.  For
example, you can ask: does `a` unify with `a` by typing `=(a, a).`?  An
alternative way of asking the same question is the more natural `a = a.`.

.Prolog terminology
********************************************************************************
We will cover these terms in more detail in class, but feel free to consult the
<<Additional resources>> for more information.

term::
  A 'term' is the basic data type in Prolog, which can be an 'atom', a
  'number', a 'variable', or a 'compound term'.
atom::
  An 'atom' is a symbol whose value is itself.  Otherwise, atoms have no
  special meaning.  Most often, symbols are just bare words such as `x` or
  `mary`, in which case they must begin with a lower-case letter.  Atoms may be
  quoted, as in `'x'`, in which case they may include spaces or start with
  upper-case letters, such as `'an atom'` or `'Atomic'`.
number::
  A 'number' is just as it sounds, a number.  Prolog has traditionally only had
  integers; however, many implementations, including SWI-Prolog, have support
  for floating point and rational numbers.  Numeric literals are written as you
  would expect, e.g. 1 is `1`.
variable::
  A 'variable' is a symbol which can stand for a value.  Variables look like
  atoms, but may not be quoted and must begin with an underscore (_) or an
  upper-case letter.  During the process of 'unification', variables get bound
  to values.  Example variables  include `A`, `Variable`, and `_variable`.
+
A variable can either be 'instantiated' or 'uninstantiated'.  An uninstantiated
variable does not have a particular value, so it can potentially be anything.
During 'unification', Prolog will instantiate a variable so that it has a
particular value.
compound term::
  A compund term is made up of an atom called a 'functor' and one or more terms
  called 'arguments'.  These look much like a function call in a language like
  Java or C.  For example, `mother(mary, jake)` is compound term where `mother`
  is the functor and `mary` and `jake` are the arguments.
unification::
  Unification is the process by which Prolog determines if two terms can the
  same.  We will delve more into the details of the unification process in
  class.
********************************************************************************

.Does `a` unify with `a`?
[source,prolog]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
?- =(a, a).
true.

?- a = a.
true.

?-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a very basic query.  You can also try performing queries with numbers
and using functors.  Try the following:

* `1 = 2.`
* `a = 1.`
* `a = 'a'.`
* `foo(a) = foo('a').`
* `foo(1) = bar(1).`
* `'hello there' = hello_there`

Now you can try mixing in a variable.  For example, you can ask, ‘what unifies
with `a`?’ using either `a = X.` or `X = a`.

.What unifies with `a`?
[source,prolog]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
?- a = X.
X = a.

?- X = a.
X = a.

?-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now try the following unifications using variables:

* `1 = X.`
* `foo(X) = foo(a).`
* `foo(X) = a.`
* `foo(X) = foo(Y).`

=== Creating a database of facts

Up until now, you have only been able to perform queries that only rely on what
you provide during the query itself.  How do you add facts that you can query?
If you try to add a fact from the current window, you will get an error.  For
example, what happens if you try to state `father(joe, jake).`?

.Try to state that `father(joe, jake).`
[source,prolog]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
?- father(joe, jake).
ERROR: toplevel: Undefined procedure: father/2 (DWIM could not correct goal)
?-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is telling your that Prolog does not know anything about `father`.  How do
you teach it?  SWI-Prolog requires you to load the facts from a file.  Download
link:facts.pl['facts.pl'] to your computer.   This is a Prolog source file that
is contains a comment and the fact `father(joe, jake).`.  Quit Prolog and
restart it by opening your copy of 'facts.pl'.  This will start SWI-Prolog
using the directory of 'facts.pl' as the working directory.  On Windows, this
should also load database.

[NOTE]
Since ‘pl’ is the same extension that is commonly used for Perl files, you may
need to right-click on the file and tell your operating system to open the file
with SWI-Prolog.

Once SWI-Prolog has started, you can be sure that the database is loaded by
typing in `[facts]`.  This is short-hand for `consult(facts)`, which will look
for and load the file called 'facts.pl'.  You should see output similar to the
following:

.Loading up 'facts.pl'
[source,prolog]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
?- [facts].
% facts compiled 0.00 sec, 2 clauses
true.

?-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, we should be able to perform a few queries:

.Querying the database
[source,prolog]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
?- father(joe, jake).
true.

?- father(jake, joe).
false.

?- father(X, jake).
X = joe.

?- father(jake, X).
false.

?- father(X, Y).
X = joe,
Y = jake.

?-
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, this is all fine and good, but the database only contains one fact.  How
can you add more?  You could edit the file 'facts.pl' outside of SWI-Prolog and
reload it using `[facts].`.  However, SWI-Prolog comes with a handy way of
doing all of this.  At the prompt, just type `edit.`.  This will bring up the
PceEmacs editor with the `facts.pl` file loaded.

.PceEmacs editing 'facts.pl'
image:pceemacs.png[]

Now, you can edit the file within this editor, which provides some syntax
highlighting and basic static analysis.

[NOTE]
If you prefer to use some other editor, feel free to consult the page on
http://www.swi-prolog.org/FAQ/BindEditor.html[selecting an editor] in the
SWI-Prolog reference.

Now you can add a few more facts.  Try adding the following:

.Some more facts
[source,prolog]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
father(jake, joan).
mother(jane, jake).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have typed these in, save the file using the 'Save buffer' command
from the 'File' menu.    Now, you can go back to SWI-Prolog and load the
changes using `make.`.

.Loading the new facts
[source,prolog]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
?- make.
% /Users/dan/comp3320/homework03/doc/facts compiled 0.00 sec, 4 clauses
true.

?-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, you can successfully query the updated database.

.Querying the updated database
[source,prolog]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- father(joe, jake).
true.

?- father(jake, joe).
false.

?- mother(X, jake).
X = jane.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also try a query like `father(X, Y).`, which lists all of the fathers
in the database.  You will notice that when you run that query it will pause
after the first result without returning to the `?-` prompt.  This means there
is more than one result.  You can press `;` to get an additional result or
press `.` to terminate.

At this point, you should have what you need to get started with your homework
assignment.


=== Getting help

It is possible to open up the SWI-Prolog manual by issuing `help.` or
`help(Topic).` at the `?-` prompt where 'Topic' is an atom to look up.

== Additional resources

To help you understand Prolog better, there are a number of resources which may
be of interest to you:

Learning Prolog::
* http://www.learnprolognow.org/[Learn Prolog Now!] is a fairly accessible
  introduction to Prolog.  This does not cover predicate logic, but covers the
  language itself well.
* Chapter 16 from 'Concepts of Programming Languages' provides an introduction
  to predicate logic, logic programming, and Prolog in particular.

About SWI-Prolog::
* The http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/refman/[SWI-Prolog reference manual]
  contains some introductory material as well as a complete
  reference for the development tools and library.
