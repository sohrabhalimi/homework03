Objectives
----------

When you have completed this homework, you should be able to:

* Write facts into a Prolog database and be able to perform queries against them
* Understand how to use variables to unify against facts
* Be able to write recursive rules


Grading
-------

For this assignment, I am trying out Piazza as a means for you to help each
other with this homework.  The purpose is to help each other learn.  As such, I
will make a portion of your grade dependent upon your participation within
Piazza and the extent to which you ask questions and help answer other people's
questions.  You can always e-mail me directly with questions, but you can ask
your peers anonymously on Piazza.  The Piazza page for our class is at
https://piazza.com/na/spring2015/comp3320/home[].

The rest of the grade will be determined based on the correctness and style of
the code you submit.  This assignment will be due at 4 Mar 2015 at 00:00 CST.


Getting started with Prolog
---------------------------

In order to complete this assignment, you will need to learn how to set up and
use Prolog.  While you can use any implementation of Prolog you wish, I suggest
you use SWI-Prolog as this will be implementation of Prolog I will be supporting.

To learn how to install and use SWI-Prolog, please refer to the
link:doc/getting-started-with-prolog.asciidoc[Getting started with Prolog]
document.


Crossword puzzle
----------------

In this exercise, you will create a simple program to solve a simple crossword
puzzle.  This should give you some experience in writing rules and using
variables, including the special singleton variable `_`.  You start with the
following facts:

.Starting facts
[source,prolog]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
word('Lisp', l, i, s, p).
word('Java', j, a, v, a).
word('ALGOL', a, l, g, o, l).
word('COBOL', c, o, b, o, l).
word('Pascal', p, a, s, c, a, l).
word('Prolog', p, r, o, l, o, g).
word('Clojure', c, l, o, j, u, r, e).
word('Fortran', f, o, r, t, r, a, n).
word('JavaScript', j, a, v, a, s, c, r, i, p, t).
word('Smalltalk', s, m, a, l, l, t, a, l, k).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

These facts give you a small dictionary of words that you will be using for the
remainder of this part of the assigment.  The first argument of word is an atom
giving the user-friendly name of a programming lanugage, while the rest of the
arguments define how each word is spelled.

=== Step 0: Getting started

You can start SWI-Prolog by opening the file 'crossword.pl'.  Once it has
started you can load the file by running `[crossword].`.  Next, you can run the
tests by using `run_tests.`.  You should see that one test is failing due to an
undefined procedure.  Run `edit.` to start working on the assignment.

=== Step 1: Identifying four-letter words

The first step in this part of the assigment is to create a new rule,
`fourLetterWord/1`, which will succeed if the argument given is a four-letter
word.  Remember that you can use the special singleton variable `_` to match
any letter.  After you have saved changes to the file, you can go back to the
`?-` prompt and run `make.`, which should reload your file and rerun the tests.

=== Step 2: Identifying five-letter words that end with 'OL'

The next step is to create `endsWithOL/1`, a rule that will test if a
five-letter word ends with the letters ‘O’ and “L’.  You can enable the test
for `endsWithOL/1` by changing the line that reads:

[source,prolog]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- begin_tests(endsWithOL, [blocked('step 2')]).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To this:

[source,prolog]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:- begin_tests(endsWithOL).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have completed this part, you should be ready for the next.

=== Step 3: Solving a simple crossword puzzle

Now that you can match parts of words, you should be able to solve a simple
crossword puzzle.  You will now create a rule `crossword/10` that takes the
arguments 'Across1', 'Across6', 'Across7', 'Across8', 'Across9', 'Down2',
'Down3', 'Down4', 'Down5', and 'Down9'.

As with the previous step, you can enable the third test to verify that you are
getting the correct answer.


Family relations
----------------

For this part of the exercise, you will be working with the database in
'family.pl'.  You should be able to write some simple rules, including some
recursive rules.

As with the last part, you should enable the various tests to help guide you in
writing your rules.  However, they are not a substitute for running queries on
your own and getting comfortable with writing Prolog.

=== Step 1: A rule for mothers

The database contains a number of facts about the sex and parent/child
relations of twenty people.  Write a rule `mother/2` that defines whether or
not someone is someone else's mother.

=== Step 2: A rule for fathers

Now, write a similar rule for fathers.


=== Step 3: Your first recursive rule

Now, write a recursive rule `ancestor/2` that determines if someone is someone
else's ancestor.

=== Step 4: Your second recursive rule

Write a recursive rule `descendant/2` that determines if someone is someone
else's descendant.  As a bonus, write a non-recursive variant that only has a
single clause.  You are allowed to use one of the rules you have already
written (but not `descendant/2`, naturally).

=== Step 5: Describe siblings

Write a rule `sibling/2` to define whether or not two people are siblings.
Additionally, try doing many sorts of queries against the rule.  Do you get any
surprissing results?  How can you improve this rule?

=== Step 6: Make your own rules

Challenge yourself and write a rule for a relationship that is not covered
above.  Impress me.
